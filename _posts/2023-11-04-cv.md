## Experience

### Community.com - Staff Systems Engineer - remote
*September 2020 - Present*

At Community.com, I have played a pivotal role in shaping infrastructure and platform strategies, embracing multiple roles, from backend engineering to security and architecture. I've led transformative projects, such as migrating the platform from Mesos to Kubernetes and implementing self-service infrastructure provisioning through Terraform and Atlantis. I also developed innovative solutions, like an AI-powered on-call helper for incident debugging. This is a role where I have to adapt and wear many hats, this type of environment is where I thrive.

Some notable projects:

- **Platform Migration:** Led a successful migration initiative, transitioning our platform from Mesos to Kubernetes (EKS). This strategic move optimized our infrastructure for enhanced scalability and efficiency. Mesos as a platform is on life support, migrating to Kubernetes provides the business with a platform that is modern, relevant and  

- **Empowering Self-Service:** Implementation of a self-service infrastructure provisioning system through GitHub pull requests, powered by Terraform and Atlantis. This innovation streamlined creation of infrastructure and review throught the well practiced git pull request review process.

- **AI-Powered On-Call Support:** Pioneered an AI-based on-call assistant, designed as an interface to OpenAI, coded in Golang. This invaluable tool aids on-call engineers in diagnosing and resolving incidents swiftly and effectively.

- **Seamless RabbitMQ Migration:** Orchestrated a zero-downtime migration of our event-bus system from AmazonMQ to Kubernetes. This migration not only significantly reduced costs but also enhanced system reliability. We havei successfully migrated RabbitMQ provider multiple times, often seeking higher throughput and stability.

- **Golang Tooling Expertise:** Developed a suite of Golang-based tools, including environment comparators, CI pipeline comparators, and GitHub pull-request monitoring solutions. These tools maintain system parity between development and production environments, fostering less man hours spent managing system parity.

In this dynamic role, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to drive impactful change, implement innovative solutions, and maintain the highest standards of system integrity. My dedication to enhancing efficiency and optimizing infrastructure has been instrumental in advancing Community.com's technological landscape.
