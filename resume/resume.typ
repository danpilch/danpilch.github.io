== Summary
#chiline()
Builder and engineering leader with 13+ years designing, scaling, and operating distributed infrastructure. I lead platform engineering at Community.com, driving everything from cloud architecture and AI/ML infra to DevOps, SRE, and hands-on software development. Deep roots in Linux and system administration, with a security-first mindset and a focus on automation and resilience. I thrive in startup environments, solving hard technical problems, wearing many hats, and building systems that are fast, secure, and cost-effective. Deep expertise in Kubernetes, cloud-native platforms, and scaling teams and systems alike.

#link("https://www.community.com/")[*Community.com*] #h(1fr) September 2020 -- Present \
Staff Platform Engineer #h(1fr) _Remote, USA_ \
- Led the zero-downtime migration of 150+ microservices serving 5M+ unique external client API requests daily from Apache Mesos (EC2) to Kubernetes (EKS), running both platforms in parallel using our custom #link("https://github.com/ninesstack/sidecar")[sidecar] service discovery layer to enable seamless cutover and instant rollback.
- Built a customer support knowledgebase as an in-product popup chat component using LLM-based RAG with Agno, CopilotKit, Python and React, implementing vector search and real-time query processing for accurate company-related answers.
- Maintained event-driven platform processing 142+ million events monthly (113M message events, 15M entity events, 11M command and 3M metric events) using RabbitMQ clusters and Protobuf schemas, ensuring reliable message delivery across distributed microservices architecture.
- Own platform strategy, architecture, and operations, working closely with executive leadership to scale infrastructure while optimising for cost and reliability.
- Created a Go-based Slack bot leveraging OpenAI `GPT-4o` to automate runbook retrieval with simple vector RAG and insert on-call context, reducing friction during incidents and slashing response time.
- Optimised cloud infrastructure, maintaining a 99.5% uptime SLA while simplifying systems and reducing complexity.
- Drove a 33% annual reduction in cloud costs (~\$320K/year) by implementing spend controls, cost-aware policies, and systematic workload rightsizing across environments.
- Driving SOC 2 Type 2 audit preparation, implementing infrastructure controls, access policies, and internal security processes to align with compliance standards.
- Developed self-service infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and Ansible, and deployed highly available RabbitMQ clusters in Kubernetes and backed by HAProxy to ensure robust messaging and load distribution.

VP Cloud Engineering #h(1fr) _Remote, UK_ \
- Contributed to the design and provisioning of core banking network infrastructure, including AWS DirectConnect, BGP, and VPC peering, using Terraform, Ansible, and Python to support secure, high-performance cloud connectivity.

#link("https://www.westpac.co.nz/")[*Westpac New Zealand*] #h(1fr) December 2018 -- November 2019 \
Senior Platform Engineer #h(1fr) _Auckland, New Zealand_ \
- Designed and implemented a fraud data processing platform using Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, and Airflow on Kubernetes. Integrated IBM MQ mainframe queues with Kafka to enable real-time fraud detection and transaction monitoring. Maintained and optimised Airflow pipelines for reliability and performance.

#link("https://bitcoin.com.au/")[*Bitcoin.com.au*] #h(1fr) November 2017 -- October 2018 \
DevOps Engineer #h(1fr) _Melbourne, Australia_ \
- Rebuilt the companyâ€™s cloud infrastructure from scratch, migrating to AWS using Terraform, Ansible, and Docker. Established isolated environments with new accounts, VPCs, and security best practices.
- Introduced GitLab and CI/CD pipelines to replace a previously unmanaged codebase, enabling version control, team collaboration, and safer deployments.
- Hardened platform during active DDoS attacks by implementing Cloudflare protections, and deployed highly available `bitcoind` nodes to ensure uptime and service reliability.

#link("https://www.ppluk.com/")[*PPL UK*] #h(1fr) July 2016 -- October 2017 \
DevOps Engineer #h(1fr) _London, UK_ \
- Led DevOps efforts during a major digital transformation initiative, modernising infrastructure with Apache Hadoop, AWS CloudFormation, and Docker in close collaboration with senior leadership.
- Rebuilt and automated the deployment of multiple Oracle WebLogic services using Selenium and Ansible, replacing fragile manual processes with reliable, repeatable pipelines.
- Developed an internal self-service platform using Rundeck, enabling non-technical teams to safely execute operational tasks and improving engineering efficiency.

#link("https://corsearch.com/incopro/")[*Incopro*] #h(1fr) May 2013 -- July 2016 \
Platform Engineer #h(1fr) _London, UK_ \
- Successfully acquired by Corsearch.
- Founding engineer at Incopro, built and scaled a distributed web scraping system using Selenium, Ansible, and residential proxies to monitor 1,000+ websites for trademark infringement.
- Designed and deployed data infrastructure using Cassandra and Elasticsearch to ingest and query gigabytes of scraped data daily for content protection and enforcement.
- Automated deployment and configuration of 500+ servers with Ansible, enabling scalable, reliable operations across a rapidly growing data platform.
