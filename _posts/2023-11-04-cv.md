## Experience

### Community.com - Staff Systems Engineer - remote

`September 2020 - Present`

At Community.com I have played a pivotal role in shaping infrastructure and platform strategies, embracing multiple roles, from backend engineering to security and architecture. I've led transformative projects, such as migrating the platform from Mesos to Kubernetes and implementing self-service infrastructure provisioning through Terraform and Atlantis. I also developed innovative solutions, like an AI-powered on-call helper for incident debugging. This is a role where I have to adapt and wear many hats, this type of environment is where I thrive.

Some notable projects:

- **Platform Migration:** Led a successful migration initiative, transitioning our platform from Mesos to Kubernetes (EKS). This strategic move optimized our infrastructure for enhanced scalability and efficiency. Mesos as a project is on life support, migrating to Kubernetes provides the business with a platform that is future proof. One of the key requirements for the migration was to support both Mesos and Kubernetes in parrallel. This was achievable with Community's custom service discovery tooling sidecar and Envoy.

- **Empowering Self-Service:** Implementation of a self-service infrastructure provisioning system through GitHub pull requests, powered by Terraform and Atlantis. This innovation streamlined creating infrastructure and review through the well practiced git pull request review process.

- **AI-Powered On-Call Support:** Pioneered an AI-based on-call assistant, designed as an interface to OpenAI, coded in Golang. This invaluable tool aids on-call engineers in triage, support and resolution of incidents, swiftly and effectively. The tool integrates as a bot within Slack which gives the AI system incident context and allows all engineers to collaborate with the tool in Slack threads.

- **Seamless RabbitMQ Migration:** Orchestrated a zero-downtime migration of our event-bus system from AmazonMQ to Kubernetes. This migration not only significantly reduced costs but also enhanced system reliability. I have successfully migrated RabbitMQ provider multiple times, seeking higher throughput and stability.

- **Golang Tooling Expertise:** Developed a suite of Golang-based tools, including environment comparators, CI pipeline comparators, and GitHub pull-request monitoring solutions. These tools maintain system parity between development and production environments, fostering less man hours spent managing system parity.
